# OrientalMotor_Device_Adapter
A Project that adapts Oriental Motors Controllers to micro-manager.  Used specifically for autofocus and other automation techniques at a lower price point.  Seeks to templatize the communication procedure.

## Note
This project should be reorganized for external contributors.  Code is documented here in its working form as a means of transparent documentation.  **Justin Hanselman (3/25/18)**
